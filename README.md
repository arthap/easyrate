# MEAN Stack RESTful API Easy Rate
<h2>MEAN Stack RESTful API Easy Rate</h2>

<img src="http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll175/michaelcheng429/meanstacktutorial_zpsu72ixs47.png" alt="mean stack tutorial app">

This repo contains the code for a RESTful API  that was built using the MEAN stack:

<ul>
<li>MYSQL</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>
 
  

<h3>Instructions</h3>

If you have trouble with the tutorial (especially since I had to modify the code due to an AngularJS update), simply clone this repo using 

    git clone https://github.com/arthap/easyrate.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

then make sure MySql is running with

    mysql

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with 

    node server

You might see a message that says, 

    Error: Module did not self-register.]
    js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version
    
Don't worry about this; the code will still work.

<h3>Have fun!</h3>
